# firstTestRepo
This is my first test repository to get aquainted with github.

## Objective
Generate, sort, and plot five realizations of random relative humidity for each day of the Year 2018.

## Organization
The necessary codes have been stored in **Codes** directory. The **Data** and **Plots** contain sample data and plot to aid the user.

*cd_runAllCodes.m* executes all the required code files and produces the results which are stored in **Data** and **Plots** folders respectively.

*usefulCommands.txt* contains useful git commands and removes the need to search for search these commands on every use.
